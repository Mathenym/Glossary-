= Glossary for Literature Review

This will be a glossary of terms, equations, and derivations needed to understand material in papers.

== Vocabulary

* *Cross Section:* (sigma) is the area transverse to particles relative motion
within which they must meet in order to scatter from each other. When a cross
section is integrated over all scattering angles (and possibly other variables)
it is called a total cross section.

* *Differential Cross Section:*  When a cross section is specified as a function
 of some final-state variable, such as particle angle or energy.

* *Kinematic Factor:* K = E1/E2 shows that the energy after scattering is only
dependent upon the mass of the 2 particles and the scattering angle of the
incident particle after the collision.

* *Correction Factor:* F, is use to account for scattering interactions outside
1 Bohr radius. In other words, it accounts for the screening caused by interacting
with the electrons in the K and higher electron shells.
